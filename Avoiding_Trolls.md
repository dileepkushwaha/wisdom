# Avoiding Trolls
Trolls, in the context of online personas, are people who engage in conversations seeking to win a battle.  These personalities are often corrosive and divisive.  Any attempt to engage a troll feeds the attention they seek even if the resulting conversation displays their foolishness.  They cannot be defeated, but they can be ignored.

## Identifying Trolls
### Contests
Please say this out loud: **A conversation is not a contest!**

If a person enters a conversation with a goal to win as though there is a contest or battle the person is a troll.  Simply do not engage this person.  They will do everything to provoke a fight.  They only lose if you do not give them the fight they seek.  You on the other hand can only lose or walk away.  Engaging this form of troll often dissolves the conversation into a toxic holy war, which is a conversation whose participants will fight exhaustively over an excruciatingly trivial subject.

### Distraction
Sometimes a person will intentionally seek to distract you away from the conversation at hand.  This is called [baiting](#baiting).  This typically occurs when a challenging opinion is contributed to somebody in disagreement who doesn't have a valid or credible response but still wishes to *win* the conversation.

### Tag Team
Sometimes trolling is a team action.  Misery loves company and in the case of apparent insecurity it will band together into teams of trolls who feel compelled to not just *win a conversation* but permanently banish an enemy challenger.  Conversations don't have enemies or winners/losers.  When this kind of toxic community is encountered kindly take their punishment respectfully or simply leave.  A toxic community will not make you wiser or happier but may certainly make you more depressed or less respectful.  See [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) for more details.

### Voting and Popularity
Some communities, for example [Reddit](http://reddit.com/), allow voting.  The result of that voting is immediately available to everybody.  Opinions aren't more or less valid because the community votes in a particular way.  This form of consensus authority quickly produces [echo chambers](#echo-chambers), which comprise a group of like-minded individuals acting in a team capacity to moderate the content of an opinion.  An opinion isn't more correct merely because it receives more *up votes* than another opinion.  Likewise, an opinion isn't necessarily more wrong merely because it receives down votes or is negatively scored.

Say this out loud: **A conversation is not a contest!**.

A lack of popularity certainly **is not** trolling, but an attacking or competitive person will use any evidence of supremacy at their disposal to qualify winning or losing.  Remember, **a conversation is not a contest**.  Identifying a person, or opinion, as trolling is an attack on a person's character, which is a form of [ad hominem](#ad-hominem) attack.  This is particularly true if such an attack is used to turn a conversation into a battle.

---

In the end if you aren't seeking to become challenged, wiser, or respectful to the people around you then you are likely a troll.  If you are easily offended or exceedingly defensive you are likely a troll.  If a conversation is a contest or ever feel that a good offense makes for a strong defense you are a troll.  If your behavior reflects team participation or indicates any form of popularity as validation of any opinion you are a troll.

Don't become a troll.

## Not Trolls
### Troll Named
Sometimes people are falsely accused of being trolls.  When a person provides a challenging response in conversation that challenges the status quo of value concession of the group that person may be falsely labeled a troll.  When a person or group is made to feel little or insecure the offending individual isn't necessarily trolling simply because the offended person(s) are challenged.  Trolling is only present when there is an attack or intentionally negative behavior.

### Causing Sadness
Some people are easily offended.  For example the mere mention of topics like *net neutrality*, *white supremacy*, or *global warming* is enough to incite bitter emotion in people.  When a person engages in a conversation directly without any intention of attack of distraction they aren't trolling simply because you became emotional.  More directly, **your sadness is not my problem**.  A person's fragile emotional state is not evidence of trolling.

If you, in your deep state of sadness and offense, respond to a person with an attack or seek to distract the person from the conversation at hand then you are a troll.  People are allowed to disagree with you no matter how sad you become.  Again, **your sadness is not my problem**.

### Ignorance
A person with a poor understanding of a conversation's subject or material isn't trolling if they make a false point out of ignorance.  It is possible they simply didn't know.  Kindly and politely provide the individual with links to educational material.  It is up to that individual if they choose to accept or consume the contents of that material.  Even after educational material is offered the other person may still remain ignorant of have a differing opinion, which is perfectly fine.

When you attempt to police the opinions of other people or force opinions upon people you become the troll.  If a difference of opinion, no matter how ignorant or uninformed, results in an attack from you then you are a troll.  **People are allowed to disagree with you.**

### Tough Questions
A person certainly isn't a troll for asking challenging questions.  Merely because a question destroys the fragility of your deeply held opinion does not mean a person is trolling.  [John Stuart Mill](http://www.bartleby.com/130/2.html) once said truth is the result of a collision of opposing points of view.  If you are incapable of accepting this without attacks or distraction you are a troll.

A person's behavior dictates whether or not they are a troll opposed to the content of their opinion.

## Avoid Becoming a Troll
When a user engages the negativity of a troll the troll wins.  The troll achieves desired attention, even if negative.  Do not allow a troll to bring you down to their level.  Always maintain the moral high ground, which is most often achieved by simply ignoring the troll or abandoning a conversation that has turned toxic.

Avoid calling out a person as a troll.  This is, even when well intended with evidence, a form of ad hominem attack.  Attacking people in any way, such as labeling people (even if warranted by their negative conduct), is itself a form of trolling.  Don't attack people.

When trolling becomes clear the best action is to walk away.  Sometimes trolling behavior isn't immediately clear.  In the case where trolling is hard to identify the best response is a **one word answer**.  The response is to a one word answer is typically enough to identify the other person's motives.  As an example when a person asks you to present evidence that you do not have simply respond with: "*No.*".  Do not elaborate in any way.

**Always be polite and respectful**, even if you are being attacked my multiple people.  The goal of a troll is to shatter your humility and self-confidence so as to attain the attention they crave.  Simply do not give into the pressure by always maintain a respectful and polite tone.

Perhaps the most challenging aspect for a well intended online citizen is to avoid baiting.  Always be vigilant and watchful that a response to a conversation is a form of distraction.  **Always keep within the field of the current conversation.**  Never respond to somebody seeking to distract you from the conversation and don't allow yourself to become distracted.

## Types of Trolling Behaviors
### Ad Hominem
A personal attack against yourself or personal character.  This is the most primitive and possibly the most common form of trolling.  This typically occurs when a person in a conversation becomes emotional and has exhausted all rational responses and yet feels the need to continue conversing in the only way they know how.

One dubious form of ad hominem is to jump straight to calling you a troll when there is no evidence of negative behavior.  This can occur if an attacking person disapproves of the communication at hand and needs to deflect their negativity directly at you when they can no longer argue the subject at hand.  This form of attack frequently occurs in [echo chambers](#echo-chamber).

#### Best Course of Action
The best course of action is to immediately terminate the conversation by not replying to or engaging the troll in any way.  If a moderator is available alert the moderation of the trolling the evidence of the bad behavior.  Regardless of whether a moderator takes any action you are done.

#### Worst Course of Action
The worst course of attack is to attack the troll, because now you are a troll as well.  They have succeeded in bring you down to their level.  If a moderator is actively present they should ban both of you.

---

### Baiting
Baiting is a form of response intended to cause offense and provoke a response without becoming an ad hominem attack.  A common example of baiting is instead of attacking you the troll attacks the nature of your commentary.  In either case the troll is seeking unwelcome attention by leaving the field of conversation.

#### Best Course of Action
Same as above for ad hominem attack.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any response at all.**  An ad hominem attack could be a rational person simply becoming frustrated and irrational.  Troll baiting is intentional.  Any response to the baiting feeds the troll and damages your character.

---

### Citation Baiting
When a conversation decays into something political a person may challenge you for evidence or a citation.  Sometimes this makes sense and elevates the conversation into greater depth and precision.  Often, though, the request for evidence occurs because a person is lazy and either cannot find the energy to do their own research or because they are using a clever form of [troll baiting](#baiting).

There are some cases a request for evidence can arise that simply don't make any sense.  Questions or challenge to asserted theories do not ever require evidence.  This bad faith request is sometimes called [sea lioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning).  Sometimes this toxic behavior is intentional and other times the requestor is simply too ignorant to understand the difference.

#### Best Course of Action
If you already have the requested evidence at hand, immediately know where to find it, or are simply curious yourself then be a kind and helpful person by quickly presenting the requested evidence.

In other cases simply respond with "*No*".  Don't do their research for them.  If this kills the current conversation at hand then so be it.  If the requesting person were really interested in the conversation they would find that evidence themselves or ask for help in finding it.  Any elaboration greater than a response of "*No*" feeds the troll and encourages additional troll attacks.

#### Worse Course of Action
If a request for evidence is completely irrational to the current conversation the requesting person is likely troll baiting.  The same details apply as for troll baiting.

### Echo Chamber
Echo Chambers are a community of trolls who come together to attack any contributions that challenges the group opinion like white blood cells protecting the body.  This is a natural occurrence that happens when online communities swell to massive sizes and moderation is not aggressive in controlling for it.  The toxic nature of an echo chamber is commonly referred to offline as *heckling*.

A highly insecure community may view any challenge to their value system as deliberate trolling, which is certainly not trolling.  This behavior is a mistaken form of social [social gadfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_gadfly) where the status quo is certainly challenged but directly so fully within the context of the current conversation without intended disruption.

Like other forms of trolling the goal is negative attention.  Unlike other forms of trolling many of the participants, sometimes called *sheep*, are not aware that they are trolling.  The common motivation for echo chamber trolling is to ensure a contributor of communications that challenge a group's value consensus, often personal insecurities, feels so punished that they are isolated and hopefully leave forever.  Its a team strategy to punish a person for the content of their message opposed to their behavior.  Echo chambers could be the unintended byproduct of [narcissistic supply](#narcissistic-supply).

#### Best Course of Action
Simply take the punishment as devout act of humility, but **absolutely do not under any circumstances change your opinion to that of the group consensus**.  Changing your opinion to the group's desired opinion reaffirms and enables their bad behavior.  You aren't wrong for having a difference of opinion.

An echo chamber is a form of moderation where the participants aren't likely moderators but feel the need to police conversations using trolling techniques in a team capacity.  Any rebuttal will feed the negativity and ignorance of persons intentionally trolling and may turn unintentional trolls into intentional trolls.

#### Worst Course of Action
Engaging the trolls is a bad mistake, but in this case isn't the worst thing either.  The worst course of action to is to cave to the group pressure and affirm their toxic values.  Instead remain forever polite and stand affirm with your opinion and humbly accept the group punishment that results.

### Narcissistic Supply
A personality who seeks to build a cult-like following for their own self-satisfaction, often as a status symbol or for self focused positive commentary.  While the cause of the problem is a single, or few, key toxic personalities the result, if they are successful, is a toxically corrupt community.

#### Best Course of Action
**Abandon the community.**  It is essentially an [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) on steroids intentionally built, directed, and reenforced by toxic leader.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  Every form of action with this type of community is a worst case scenario.

### Social Justice Warrior
A social justice warrior is a fierce warrior seeking to do battle to right the social ills plaguing the world.  While this motivation is certainly noble it often has no place in many online communities and is often perceived as a horrid pest.  The primary difference between a social justice warrior and an [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) victim is that a social justice warrior is focused on subjects completely outside the scope of the community.

The unique challenge posed by social justice warrior is that they are not at war with just a single person.  They are at war with the entire community.  A typical troll focused on trolling a single person, or select few people, can be easily managed by simply ignoring them until they go away.  The problem with the social justice warriors is that to defeat this kind of troll everybody in the community must ignore them until they go away, which is unlikely at best.

#### Best Course of Action
Report the toxic individual to community moderators so that they can be banned from the community.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  If somebody else engages this type of troll kindly and respectfully tell them to stop.

---

### Spamming
Spamming, or sometimes called [shitposting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting) is a deliberate form of annoyance to aggressively contribute low quality material in high quantities.  A form of maximum effect annoyance from least effort.  They are seeking attention from limited effort.

#### Best Course of Action
If the troll isn't disrupting access to conversations or disrupting the flow of conversation simply ignore them.  If their trolling does disrupt how the community operates ban them.  Either way the goal is to dramatically increase the required effort needed to attain the desired attention.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  Any form of engagement will enable their continued assault on the community.

---

### Stalking
Stalking behavior is usually an escalated response from an aggressively determined troll.  An example is when a well minded online citizen properly ignores a troll attack but the troll is dedicated upon seeking the desired attention by following the victim into different conversations or online communities.

#### Best Course of Action
**Report the troll to moderators.**  Once they are done stalking you they will likely pray upon somebody else.  This sort of behavior should be permanently removed from online communities with a permanent ban.  If the given chat application or community has a blocking feature block the stalker so that you are incapable of receiving or viewing their communications.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any response at all.**  The goal is to aggressively illicit your feedback.  Do not give in.  Continue to ignore them at all costs.  If you do crack and respond to the troll they will continue to troll you because they know they can get to you.
